### To-DO
- [x] Write the ROCL implementation
- [x] Write the RELIC loss implementation.(having trouble with the invariant regularizer term)
- [ ] Train and check if  ROCL code eproduces the result: In progres
- [ ] Check RELIC loss with different architectures 
- [ ] Commit RELIC loss file : In progress
